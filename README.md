# Bikesharing Analysis with CitiBike

## Overview
Citi Bike is the nation's largest bike share program, with 25,000 bikes and over 1,500 stations across Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, Jersey City and Hoboken. In this analysis, I analyzed Citi Bike trip history data from August 2019. I used Pandas to clean the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime data type. Then created a set of visualizations to:
- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

Finally, I added these new visualizations to a Tableau story presentation summarizing the analysis.

## Process
I used Pandas to change the datatype of the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype to get the time in hours and minutes. [Jupyter Notebook file] ()

How: identified current data types, converted, added to a new column, and exported the cleaned dataset.

Created visualizations in Tableau Public (version?) with worksheets, combined insights to a customer dashboard, and built a story.

## Summary
- a high-level summary of the results 
- two additional visualizations are suggested for future analysis
- -- Looking at the CitiBike website - there's an option for a single "day pass" - would be interesting to track that in addition to customers and subscribers.
